# Part Two
## Breakdown of code
The goal of this part is to add new statements `insert` and `select` to our program
as well as separate our statements from commands. 

"meta" commands are any command entered that starts with a ".", such as ".exit"

Statements are keywords such as "select" and "insert" that will eventually allow us to insert data into our
database as well as show all our rows with "selct"
